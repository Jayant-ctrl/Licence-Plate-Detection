# ðŸ’Ž Features
##  1. The project uses YOLO V8 custom trained model to detect the position of licence plate on vehicles.
##  2. The detection results are then used to extract the image of licence plate from the main image.
##  3. The image is then fed into the EasyOCR library to detect the numbers on Licence Plate.
  
####   This system is an overview of how a basic Licence Plate Detection System works.
####  ðŸ”´  Improvements can be made by:
####     1.Training the model with a bigger dataset.
####     2.Using a more accurate tool for OCR.
